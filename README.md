### Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/maurizioorani/QuizMasterPro.git
cd QuizMasterPro

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch application
streamlit run src/quizmaster/streamlit_app.py
```

### Model Setup (Choose One or Both)

**Option A: OpenAI Models**
```bash
# Configure OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

**Option B: Local Ollama Models**
```bash
# Install Ollama (visit https://ollama.ai/)
ollama serve

# Models auto-download when selected in app
```

## üéØ How to Use

### 1. **Process Documents & Extract Topics**
- Upload PDF, DOCX, TXT, or HTML files
- **AI automatically extracts key concepts** using dual-source analysis:
  - ContextGem for advanced document understanding  
  - Direct LLM analysis for topic identification
- **Review extracted concepts** organized by categories (Key Definitions, Main Ideas, Important Facts)
- Documents stored persistently with concept metadata for reuse

### 2. **Interactive Topic Selection**
- **Browse automatically extracted concepts** in an organized interface
- **Select specific topics** you want to focus on for learning
- **Combine multiple concepts** from different categories
- **Use "Select All" or individual checkboxes** for fine-grained control
- Preview selected concepts before quiz generation

### 3. **Generate Targeted Quiz**
- **Configure quiz settings**: question types, difficulty, number of questions
- **Select your AI model**: Choose between OpenAI or local Ollama models  
- **Enable model synchronization** for consistent concept extraction and quiz generation
- AI creates questions **focused exclusively on your selected topics**
- Get immediate feedback and detailed explanations

### 4. **Analyze Performance & Track Progress**
- Receive detailed insights and analytics on your selected topics
- Get personalized study recommendations based on performance
- Track learning progress over time with concept-specific metrics
- Review which topics need more attention

## üîß Model Configuration

### Document Processing & Quiz Generation
**üèÜ Recommended Local Models (Ollama):**
- **`deepseek-r1`** - Advanced reasoning and structured output
- **`mistral:7b`** - Excellent JSON generation (4.1GB)
- **`qwen2.5:7b`** - Strong structured output (4.4GB)
- **`gemma2:9b`** - Reliable instruction following (5.4GB)

**‚òÅÔ∏è OpenAI Models:**
- **`gpt-4o-mini`** - Fast and cost-effective
- **`gpt-4o`** - High-quality structured output

### Document Processing with ContextGem
- **ContextGem Integration**: We leverage ContextGem for advanced document understanding and concept extraction. ContextGem is ideal for this application because it excels at breaking down complex documents into structured, meaningful concepts and aspects, which is crucial for generating targeted and relevant quiz questions. Its ability to identify key definitions, main ideas, and important facts directly supports our goal of transforming documents into personalized learning experiences.
- **Smart Retrieval**: Semantic search based on extracted concepts allows for efficient retrieval of relevant document sections for quiz generation.
- **Rich Metadata**: Document structure, creation timestamps, and extraction summaries are stored as metadata for comprehensive document management.
- **Topic Mapping**: Organized concept categories facilitate targeted quiz generation based on specific topics selected by the user.

### Intelligent Analytics Pipeline
- **Performance analysis**: Multi-dimensional scoring and pattern recognition
- **Learning style detection**: Adaptive recommendations based on quiz behavior
- **Cognitive load assessment**: Personalized study strategies and pacing
- **Progress benchmarking**: Milestone tracking and improvement measurement

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Solutions
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Ollama connection failed | Run `ollama serve` and ensure port 11434 is available |
| OpenAI API errors | Verify OpenAI API key in `.env` file (if using OpenAI models) |
